<h1>Shrek</h1>
<hr>
<p>Shrek is a green humanoid ogre once living alone with a resentment towards those who judged him by appearance. He would open up after meeting his best friend Donkey and wife Fiona, having a new perspective on society's views towards ogres. This would lead Shrek to become heir to the kingdom of Far Far Away, and raise three children.

He was originally created by American author William Steig in his 1990 picture book, Shrek!. Shrek was originally voiced by Chris Farley, but due to his death in 1997, the role was given to Mike Myers. In the musical, Shrek was played principally by Brian D'Arcy James.
Before meeting Donkey and Fiona, Shrek lived a solitary life, preferring not to associate himself with others due to people's fear of him, while occasionally playing on their fear to frighten away intruders. During his quest to rescue Fiona and get his swamp back, however, Shrek slowly begins to open up to his companions, revealing his insecurities about how others perceive him. With assistance from Donkey, Shrek realizes his feelings for Fiona and confesses his love for her during her wedding to Lord Farquaad. He’s fiercely protective of Fiona and his allies and he’ll go to great lengths to help them in any way. Since marrying Fiona, Shrek would have been deathly afraid of the prospect of having children, possibly due to his own upbringing as an ogre. By the end of Shrek the Third, however, he overcomes this fear and proves to be a caring and loving father.
